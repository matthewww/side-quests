# Session Summary: Audiobook Normalization Script Development

This session focused on enhancing and debugging the `normalize_audiobooks.py` script to improve its functionality and robustness for processing audiobooks.

## Timeline of Changes

*   **Initial Problem Identification**: User reported issues with combining `.m4a` files into a single `.m4b` with chapters for "The Mysterious Benedict Society."
*   **Chapter Generation Implementation**: Modified `handle_multiple_files` to create chapter markers using `ffprobe` and a metadata file for `ffmpeg`.
*   **Cover Art Download (Initial Attempt)**: Added `download_cover_art` function using `default_api.google_web_search` (later identified as an issue for script execution).
*   **Output Directory Restructuring**: Updated `ROOT_DIR` and output paths to place normalized audiobooks and metadata in a `normalized_audiobooks` subdirectory in the project root, with per-book folders.
*   **`FileNotFoundError` Fix**: Corrected the order of operations in `main` to ensure `normalized_audiobooks` directory is created before `metadata_report.jsonl` is written.
*   **`default_api` Not Defined Fix**: Replaced `default_api.google_web_search` with direct `requests` calls to Open Library API for cover art download, removing the dependency on the CLI's internal tools.
*   **FFmpeg Stream Map Error Fix**: Corrected `ffmpeg` command to use `-map_metadata 1` for chapter metadata, resolving "Stream map matches no streams" error.
*   **User Confirmation Step**: Added an interactive prompt in `main` to ask for user approval before starting the conversion process.
*   **Syntax Error Debugging (Iterative)**: Repeatedly fixed `SyntaxError` issues related to malformed `print` statements and unescaped newline characters.
*   **Problematic File Handling**: Implemented a system to identify and separate problematic audio files (those with `ffprobe` errors).
*   **Re-encoding Problematic Files**: Added `re_encode_audio_file` function and integrated it into `handle_multiple_files` to re-encode problematic `.m4a` files to AAC before concatenation.
*   **Separate Processing for Problematic Books**: Modified `main` to process normal books first, then prompt for separate user confirmation before attempting to process problematic books.
*   **Documentation Creation**: Created `readme.md` and `gemini.md` files for project overview and agent-specific instructions.

## Key Insights & Learnings

1.  **Chapter Generation**: Implemented the ability to generate chapters in the final `.m4b` files based on the individual input audio file names. This involved creating a metadata file and passing it to `ffmpeg`.
2.  **Cover Art Download**:
    *   Initially attempted to use `google_web_search` (my internal tool) for cover art, but realized the Python script couldn't directly access it.
    *   Switched to using the **Open Library Covers API** (`requests` library) as a free and keyless alternative for downloading missing cover art. This involved searching Open Library for book titles and then fetching covers via ISBN.
3.  **Error Handling & Robustness**:
    *   **FFmpeg Command Order**: Corrected the `ffmpeg` command argument order, specifically for `-map_metadata`, to ensure proper application of chapter metadata and image mapping.
    *   **Problematic Files**: Introduced a mechanism to identify and separate "problematic" audio files (those causing `ffprobe` errors, e.g., "Invalid data found").
    *   **Re-encoding**: Implemented a re-encoding step for problematic `.m4a` files to AAC format, making them compatible with `ffmpeg` and preventing chapter skipping.
    *   **User Confirmation**: Added interactive prompts to allow the user to approve processing of "normal" books and then separately for "problematic" books, providing more control.
4.  **Output Structure**: Modified the script to organize all normalized output (final `.m4b` files, `metadata_report.jsonl`, and temporary files) into a dedicated `normalized_audiobooks` directory in the project root, with each book getting its own subdirectory.
5.  **Directory Handling**: Ensured the output directory is created *before* any files are written into it, resolving `FileNotFoundError`.
6.  **Syntax Debugging**: Iteratively fixed several `SyntaxError` issues, primarily related to incorrect string literals and newline characters in `print` statements within the Python script. This highlighted the importance of precise string matching for `replace` operations.
7.  **Project Documentation**: Created `readme.md` and `gemini.md` files to document the project and provide guidance for future interactions.

## Commands Used (by the user)

- `python normalize_audiobooks.py` (for running the script and observing output/errors)

## Tools Used (by the agent)

- `read_file`: To inspect file contents and understand existing code.
- `replace`: To modify existing code, fix errors, and implement new features.
- `write_file`: To create new files like `readme.md`, `gemini.md`, and `session-summary.md`.
- `run_shell_command`: To execute the Python script and observe its output/errors.
- `google_web_search`: (Initially used for cover art search, then replaced by direct `requests` calls to Open Library API).
