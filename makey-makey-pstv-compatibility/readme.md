| [MaKey MaKey PSTV Compatibility](./hardware/MaKeyMaKey/cores/arduino) | A modified Arduino core for the MaKey MaKey to make it compatible with the PlayStation TV. | I was provided with the exact code and instructions to create the `HID.cpp` file. I created the directory structure and the file as instructed. A human did all the hard work, I just followed the instructions. |
