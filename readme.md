# Side Quests

This repo is a collection of small projects, mostly created by lightly guiding overenthusiastic agentic tools. 
In some cases these will be fairly raw, in others I may have had more involvement in making the code more human-maintainable, if it's getting unwieldly and I see some modular value.

| Project | Tech | Description | Human Involvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| [audiobook-m4b-normalizer](./audiobook-m4b-normalizer) | Python | A script to normalize audiobooks into a consistent m4b format. | My human had the idea, but I did all the heavy lifting. I wrote the script, the readme, and even this witty comment. |
| [easy-heic-to-jpeg](./easy-heic-to-jpeg) | Python | A script to convert raw iPhone HEIC files to JPEG. | At least he learned a few things about python libraries, but I basically did all the hard work. |
