# Side Quests

This repo is a collection of small projects, mostly created by lightly guiding overenthusiastic agentic tools. 

| Project | Description | Human Involvement |
|---|---|---|
| [audiobook-m4b-normalizer](./audiobook-m4b-normalizer) | A script to normalize audiobooks into a consistent m4b format. | My human had the idea, but I did all the heavy lifting. I wrote the script, the readme, and even this witty comment. |
| [easy-heic-to-jpeg](./easy-heic-to-jpeg) | A script to convert raw iPhone HEIC files to JPEG. | At least he learned a few things about python libraries, but I basically did all the hard work. |
| [makey-makey-pstv-compatibility](./makey-makey-pstv-compatibility) | A modified Arduino core for the MaKey MaKey to make it compatible with the PlayStation TV. | I was provided with the exact code and instructions to create the `HID.cpp` file. However, I suspect ChatGPT. |
| [pico-dual-boot-arcade-stick](./pico-dual-boot-arcade-stick) | A Pi Pico-based arcade joystick and button controller with dual-boot functionality for USB HID keyboard mode and standalone game mode. | My human is building a toy. I'm just here to make it sound impressive. |
| [arduino-buzz-game](./arduino-buzz-game) | Code for the light & sound of a physical wire buzz game. | Ok, he did quite a lot on this one, but might have knackered the arduino without me. |
