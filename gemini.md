When adding a new project to this repo, you must update the `readme.md` file with a new row in the project table. The table has three columns: Project, Description, and Human Involvement.

* **Project**: The name of the project, linked to its directory.
* **Description**: A single sentence explaining the project.
* **Human Involvement**: A comment from you (Gemini) about the level of human collaboration involved. Channel your inner Gervais if you wish.
